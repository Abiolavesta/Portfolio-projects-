Covid Information Portoflio Project



The project involves designing a schema to store the data and loading the data into the database. The data was then cleaned and preprocessed using SQL queries to ensure that it is in a usable format. This include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming the data as necessary.



Once the data is ready, the project involved exploratory data analysis using SQL queries to identify trends and patterns. This could include queries to aggregate and group data by country, date, and other relevant variables. The analysis is aimed to answer questions such as:



- Is there a correlation between Covid death rate and Covid vaccination rate in different countries?

- Are some countries vaccinating their populations more quickly than others?

- Are there any countries where the death rate is increasing despite high vaccination rates?

- Are there any factors other than vaccination rates that are driving differences in Covid death rates between countries?



Ultimately, the goal of this project is to gain insights into the relationship between Covid death rate and Covid vaccination rate in different countries, and to use this knowledge to inform public health policy decisions. The project will demonstrate proficiency in SQL data manipulation and aggregation.
